Installing: By clicking on the Run button in Android Studio you can install the application on your phone.

### Android Studio as your main IDE

The recommended IDE for Android development is [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) because it is developed and constantly updated by Google, has good support for Gradle, contains a range of useful monitoring and analysis tools and is fully tailored for Android development.

Avoid adding Android Studio's specific configuration files, such as `.iml` files to the version control system as these often contain configurations specific of your local machine, which won't work for your colleagues.
